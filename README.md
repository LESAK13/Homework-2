# Homework-2

For this homework assignment, it was necessary to design a responsive portfolio.  After setting up the basic html code for each of the three webpages (index, portfolio and contact), the first requirement was the navbar.  This was simply copy, pasted and adapted from Bootstrap on each of the three pages.  It was necessary to adapt the href links so that each button on the navbar directed to the correct page.

Once the navbar was complete, adapting the bootstrap documentation into my webpages was easy enough.  For example, on the contact.html page, I copied one of the form documentation components to get the base design for my contact form.  Next, it was easy enough to adapt to fit the requirements of the homework.  Images were added on the index.html page and the portfolio.html page and buttons were used on the portfolio.html page to link to some of the things I've completed so far.

Lastly, it was required that the websites were responsive across different viewports.  To accomplish this, I adjusted the column sizes to adapt to each type of screen size.  The bootstrap grid is easy to use.

I also added some simple styling with CSS.

* I left the last link for my 'rock paper scissors' page empty as of now.  I wanted a third element to my portfolio page.
